### getting started

this docker file will pull in all images needed to run the databox-sdk.  Note that it mounts volumes on the host directory (by default /opt, set in .env).

 OSX restricts the directories that your are able to mount to, and will fail if you do not explicitly set a legal directory.  To do this do:

```
export HOSTMOUNT=~/dockermnt
```

and then when up and running you should see volumes created there

To get started just run

```
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml databox-sdk
```
